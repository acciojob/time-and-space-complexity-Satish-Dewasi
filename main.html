 <h1> Time and Space Complexity </h1>

	<p>

		Time complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task. For example, if a program takes 100 seconds to run while another program completes the same task in 200 seconds, then clearly the first program has low time complexity. Therefore, as a programmer, your goal is to reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizing it and making it more efficient.
