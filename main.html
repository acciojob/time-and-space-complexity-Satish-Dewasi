<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

<p>When we analyze algorithms, one of the key aspects we consider is <b>time complexity</b>. Time complexity measures how efficiently an algorithm uses time resources as the input size increases. An algorithm is said to have efficient time complexity if its performance remains reasonable even as the input grows. It's important to design algorithms that can handle larger datasets without becoming impractical or slow.</p>

<p><b>Space complexity</b> is another essential concept. It refers to the amount of memory or space an algorithm requires to solve a problem based on the input size. An algorithm with low space complexity uses a small and constant amount of memory regardless of the input size. In some cases, algorithms may have <b>space complexity of O(n)</b>, where 'n' represents the size of the input. This means the memory usage grows linearly with the input size. Proper management of space complexity ensures efficient memory usage and prevents running out of memory in resource-constrained environments.</p>
